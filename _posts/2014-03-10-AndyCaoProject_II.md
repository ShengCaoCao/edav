## Project: Explore Life Insurance Data -- Second Sprint
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### First Sprint Accomplishment 
For the three week period between 2/17 and 3/10, I would like to: 

* Talk to the data source and collect data.
* Check for missing data, will need to work with the data source to find alternate database that might contain the same information. Once the alternative data sources are identified, will need to wrangle the data into format that's consistent with the original dataset. 
* Examine the relationships between the variables, and create some preliminary graphs.
* Study some indsutry reports about how this type of data are usually analyzed.
